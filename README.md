# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the game board and UI elements.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the game board and other UI components.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, including handling player turns, checking for wins or draws, and restarting the game.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Play against another player on the same device.
- **Responsive design**: The game board adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Restart functionality**: Easily restart the game with a button click.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the cells of the 3x3 grid.
3. The first player to align three of their marks (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game is a draw.
5. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.

## Development

To modify the game, you can edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed. The game logic is primarily contained within `script.js`, which handles player turns, win conditions, and game restarts.
